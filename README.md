# Getting-Giphy-With-It
APIs &amp; AJAX

I absolutely adore gifs so I was pretty excited to do this homework, and I couldn't decide on a topic, so I decided to do a little (or a lot) of everything. Plus I wanted to make up for the week before. I'm pretty happy with the final result. It could always stand to look a little better and be more responsive, though. There's lots more to learn!

# Flow
On the landing page users can search for any keyword they wish and have gifs load from the Giphy API. The webpage will also remember what has been searched for and create buttons that the user can click on in the future to see the gifs again. On the other pages, users can find preselected fields they can click on to query gifs of specific keywords, or choose to search for one of their own which will also add it to the list. 

# Future Goals
Better styling and perhaps deploying the site in the future with a backend.
