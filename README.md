# Getting-Giphy-With-It
APIs &amp; AJAX

I absolutely adore gifs so I was pretty excited to do this homework, and I couldn't decide on a topic, so I decided to do a little (or a lot) of everything. Plus I wanted to make up for the week before. I feel like I kind of went the lazy route by making .js files for every page; I'm sure I could have coded something more complex to work out what topics belonged on which page, but oh well. I'm pretty happy with the final result. It could always stand to look a little better and be more responsive, though. There's lots more to learn!
